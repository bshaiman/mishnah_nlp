# Topic Modeling the Mishnah
***“What was Rabbi Akiva like? He was like a laborer who took up his basket and went out. Finding wheat, he put it in. Finding barley, he put it in. Finding spelt, he put it in. Finding lentils, he put them in. Upon arriving at his home he sorted the wheat on its own, the barley on its own, the beans on their own, and the lentils on their own. Thus did Rabbi Akiva proceed when he made the entire Torah into links upon links.“***  
-Avot d’Rabbi Natan A:18, 34A (late 3rd Century CE Midrash)  
### ***What is the Mishnah?***  
Good question. The mishnah is not easily defined, and to do it justice it is a good idea to put it in its historical context.  
Before the first century CE, the jewish faith was extremely different. It was still, in practice, the simple bronze-age city-cult of Jerusalem. A sacrificial state religion centered on a single temple in what is now Israel/Palestine. Its practice was primarily based on adherence to certain already-established dietary, moral, and practical restrictions, as well as tithing to the ruling dynasty and a small tribe of priests who administered the temple.  
This all changed in 70 CE, when after decades of rebellion and a multi-year siege, soldiers of the Roman Empire entered the city of Jerusalem and sacked it. In the process they destroyed the temple and initiated the modern Jewish diaspora.  
In the absence of temple, the priestly elite, and the the ruling authority, the religion needed to be reformed. An already active movement turning the religion towards legalism, in a very similar path that Christianity and Islam would follow in the next millenium, came to the forefront of Jewish thought. This movement re-focussed the religion from a sacrificial system to a devotional once. Rather than the burnt animal sacrifices of Jerusalem, Judaism came to be marked by the legal interpretation of the original 'Old Testament', endogamy (marriage only within the cultural group), prayer, and practice. This process had been started some hundreds of years earlier. Already, there was developping an oral tradition of laws, philosophy, and theology that came to descrive the religion. This oral collection eventually became what is now known as the Mishnah. In summary, it became a kind of civil and religious common law.  
Some time around 200 CE, a rabbi named Yehuda HaNasi (literally "The Prince") in Roman Judea compiled and editted this oral tradition. In doing so, it was organized into collections known as Sedarim ("orders"), Masekhot ('tractates'), Chapters, and individual mishnahs, usually of the length of what we might call paragraphs. **These will be my documents.**

##### For the purposes of this study I will use the english translation supplied by Sefaria.org. Some terms are left as hebrew to english transliteration, and I will attempt to retain these and use them to make sense as best I can.  

## Part 1 - Web-Scraping  and Pre-Processing  
Because the study of the mishnah, and its commentaries is still very much alive and well amongst various Jewish communities, there are several digital resources with a variety of translations. I used the base sefaria translation by professors Joshua Kulp at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. It is exceptional for its inclusion of parenthetical clarrification of indefinite pronouns, jargon, and hebrew terms.  
On Sefaria.org, the tractates of the mishnah are laid out in a table, so it is a simple task to use Beautiful Soup to loop through the first 64 links, corresponding to the 64 tractates of the mishnah. First, we need to bring in the packages I will use:
<pre><code>
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML 
from collections import defaultdict
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import spacy
import requests
import re
</code></pre>  
Then it is a simple matter of setting up the code to pull the links and their pages' information, and use them to populate a series of numpy arrays:  
<pre><code>
url = 'https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Mishnah'
response = requests.get(url)
#Already checked that response gives us a 200 status_code
page = response.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "lxml")
soup = soup.find_all('td')
tractates = []
chapters = []
mishnaot = []
texts = []
for i in range(0,63):
    tractate = soup[i].find(class_='en').text
    print(tractate)
    link = soup[i].find('a')
    link = 'https://www.sefaria.org'+link['href']
    link = link[:-1]
    chapter = 1
    while requests.get(link+str(chapter)+'?lang=en'):
        response = requests.get(link+str(chapter)+'?lang=en')
        page = response.text
        tractate_soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "lxml").find_all('p',class_='en')
        for mishnah,text in enumerate(tractate_soup):
            tractates.append(tractate)
            chapters.append(chapter)
            mishnaot.append(mishnah+1)
            texts.append(text.text)
        chapter+=1
</code></pre>  
I then formed a Pandas dataframe out of these arrays:  
<pre><code>
mishnah_df = pd.DataFrame(np.array([tractates,chapters,mishnaot,texts]).T)
mishnah_df.columns = ['tractate','chapter','mishnah','text']
mishnah_df.tractate = mishnah_df.tractate.apply(lambda row: row.strip())
</code></pre>  
At this stage I also grouped the tractates into their respective orders ("Sedarim"), the higher-level grouping of the mishnah. Luckily, the mishnah is not very long, only 4,083 documents, ranging from half a dozen to a score of sentences. Therefore using a static csv file made sense for the needs of this project.  
I then went about some cleaning operations:
##### Handling Names:  
One problem with the form of the text was the inconsistency of certain names. These would become critical for later analyses, so I decided to handle it at this stage. Through my own domain knowledge and a few physical resources, it was easy to compile a list of names, review their spelling permutations in the documents, and choose single standardized versions. I then replaced other spellings of the names I found with my standardized version.  
I then created spacy-docs out of my documents, applying over the whole data frame:
<pre><code>
df['spacy_doc'] = list(nlp.pipe(df.text))
</code></pre>  
When considering the length of this corpus, it quickly became apparent that lemmatization, breaking words down into base grammatical forms would be usefull. Thereby common terms like 'say' and 'said' would nont be unnecessarily parsed as different. Since some untranslated Hebrew terms would get interpreted as proper nouns, I made sure to also leave these terms out of the process.  
## Part 2 - Topic Modeling  
For topic modling I had to bring in a couple of more packages:
<pre><code>
from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix, csr_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
</code></pre>
These would provide critical functionality for processing the corpus before implementing a vectorizer, and visualization.  
***Note*** that I had already loaded in my data as:  
<pre><code>
df = pd.read_csv('mishnah.csv')
</code></pre>
#### Unsupervised Framework
To show my process in topic modeling, I used the entire corpus, first. At this stage I was looking to see if I could accurately group the texts into their 6 super-categories, as outlined in the introduction. After some trial and error regarding topic interpretability, I decided on a max_df of 5%. Without this step, too many terms that are common amongst too many documents would come as the most ciritcal terms for grouping. 
<pre><code>
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
#Setting up the vectorizer
cv = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=final_stop,ngram_range=(1,2),max_df = 0.05)
#Transforming the full corpus dataset using the vectorizer
X = cv.fit_transform(df.tokens)
#Re-forming my TFIDF vectorizer as a dataframe with words as columns
tfidf = pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=cv.get_feature_names())
print('got tfidf\n')
#Inserting this dataframe into a sparse matrix
sparse_mtx = csr_matrix(tfidf.values)
print('got sparse matrix\n')
words = tfidf.columns
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
#Setting up my non-negative factorization to default to 6 components, corresponding to the 6 super-topics
model = NMF(n_components=6, init='random', random_state=0, max_iter = 2000)
#Transforming by that model
doc_topics = model.fit_transform(sparse_mtx)
print('fit nmf\n')
#Getting the top words for each topic
t = model.components_.argsort(axis=1)[:,-1:-9:-1]
topic_words = [[words[e] for e in l] for l in t]
topic_words
</code></pre>
This produced an output like:
<pre><code>
[['domain',
  'sell',
  'field',
  'pay',
  'cubit',
  'public',
  'tree',
  'public domain'],
 ['susceptible',
  'susceptible impurity',
  'susceptible uncleanness',
  'midra',
  'midra uncleanness',
  'susceptible midra',
  'corpse uncleanness',
  'metal'],
 ['become unclean',
  'handbreadth',
  'remain clean',
  'hive',
  'touch',
  'oven',
  'size',
  'everything'],
 ['brother',
  'marry',
  'halitzah',
  'sister',
  'husband',
  'perform',
  'daughter',
  'perform halitzah'],
 ['vow',
  'nazirite',
  'beth',
  'annul',
  'benefit',
  'konam',
  'behold',
  'behold nazirite'],
 ['slaughter',
  'offer',
  'hatat',
  'defile',
  'burn',
  'outside',
  'sacrilege',
  'sprinkle']]
</code></pre>
Now, you are going to have to beleive me that many of these terms to mean something to someone familiar with Mishanh. For instance, the first group with the terms 'field', 'tree', and 'cubit' (an ancient unit of measurement) would unmistakably correspond to the order 'Zeraim', agircultural law. Likewise with the second group and 'Tohorot', the laws of impurity. Using this basic process of elimenation, I then assign an order to the topics, corresponding to the order of lists of terms rendered above:
<pre><code>
predicted_topics = []
topic_assignments = ['Zeraim','Toharot','Moed','Nashim','Nezikin','Kadoshim']
</code></pre>
I then looped through the array of document-topic weights and assigned each document a topic based on which topic was found to have the most weight in each document based on term frequency:
<pre><code>
for doc in doc_topics:
    predicted_topics.append(topic_assignments[np.argmax(doc)])
</code></pre>
Then, to compare my predictions to the actual topics, I did a simple element-wise comparison between the topics in the base dataframe, and those that I had just assigned:
<pre><code>
rights = (df.seder==predicted_topics).values
</code></pre>
The ScikitLearn framework makes it exceedingly easy to test accuracy of clasffication techniques. Using the true array of topics, and the topic-assignments as I had made them, I got a score of my accuracy as well as a Seaborn heatmap to see what was going well and what was not:
<pre><code>
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,precision_score,recall_score,confusion_matrix
print('Accuracy: {}'.format(accuracy_score(df.seder,predicted_topics)))
print('Precision: {}'.format(precision_score(df.seder,predicted_topics,average='weighted')))
print('Recall: {}'.format(recall_score(df.seder,predicted_topics,average='weighted')))
c_mat = confusion_matrix(df.seder,predicted_topics,normalize='true')
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.heatmap(c_mat, cmap=plt.cm.Blues, annot=True, square=True,
           xticklabels=df.seder.unique(),
           yticklabels=df.seder.unique())
plt.xlabel('Predicted Seder')
plt.ylabel('Actual Seder')
</code></pre>
This output:  
![Full Mishnah Heatmap](visualizations/mishnah_full_heatmap.png)  
Obviously this had some problems. The overwhelming one was that there was simply too much dispersion within topics. This makes sense in the context of the Mishnah. The order 'Moed' for example, covers all major Jewish holidays, whose prcatices are varied and multifarious. But this was not telling the whole story, and using even more dimensionality reduction, I could go deeper.  
I brought in the t-SNE tool from ScikitLearn, which is purpose built to visualize high-dimensional data. Essentially, it further reduced the dimensionality of my topic-data to two, which are easily visualizable:
<pre><code>
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
arr = pd.DataFrame(doc_topics)
topic_num = np.argmax(doc_topics, axis=0)
tsne_model = TSNE(n_components=2, verbose=1, random_state=0, angle=.99, init='pca')
tsne_lda = tsne_model.fit_transform(arr)
</code></pre>
I then plotted the two new dimensions rendered by this algorithm. Here documents are colored by assigned topics, and marked with x's for correct assignments, and circles for wrong ones:
![Full Mishnah Clustering](visualizations/mishnah_full_tsne_clusters.png)  
It showed my basic assumption to be correct. For some few, this unsupervised framework was working relatively well, but for others, where the difference between a clear match to one topic versus another became fuzzy, the framework broke down. You might also notice that 'Zeraim', which purportedly had 70% accuracy under this framework, is shown in blue. And a large part of the middle, ambiguous collection of documents is colored blue. This is indication that a large problem with this framework is the ballancing of topics, with some being given overly-wide brushes.  
#### Supervised Framework  
I then set out to see how far traditional classifcation could take this problem. I set up a framework where instead of human-assisted unsupervised learning, I would implement a supervised learning technique. I performed a train-test split on the data, ballanced according to the weights of each super-topic in the corpus, and set up a loop. In this loop I simply re-formed my NMF model while ammending a single variable:
<pre><code>
for n in [1,2,4,11,25,50,100]:
    model = NMF(n_components=n, init='random', random_state=0, max_iter = 2000)
    X_train = model.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = model.transform(X_test)
</code></pre>
As you can see, the variable in question is the number of components. The idea here is to imitate a more traditional basic classification framework. The problem with attempting to regress on high-dimensional data is that often the actual information gain from this data, rather than improving performance, shows diminishing returns. Sometimes it even reflects a potential concavity in accuracy. Therefore I set about repeating this classification with more and more dimensions to the predictor data to illustrate this problem. I performed this same classification with various models and tracked their performance over the different number of features:
![Full Mishnah ACC](visualizations/mishnah_full_acc.png)  
And as we can see, after the first couple-dozen features, the preformance gain becomes negligible. Indeed, it maxes out in the mid-60th percentile.
