# Topic Modeling the Mishnah
->***“What was Rabbi Akiva like? He was like a laborer who took up his basket and went out. Finding wheat, he put it in. Finding barley, he put it in. Finding spelt, he put it in. Finding lentils, he put them in. Upon arriving at his home he sorted the wheat on its own, the barley on its own, the beans on their own, and the lentils on their own. Thus did Rabbi Akiva proceed when he made the entire Torah into links upon links.“***  
-Avot d’Rabbi Natan A:18, 34A (late 3rd Century CE Midrash)<-

### ***What is the Mishnah?***  
Good question. The mishnah is not easily defined, and to do it justice it is a good idea to put it in its historical context.  
Before the first century CE, the jewish faith was extremely different. It was still, in practice, the simple bronze-age city-cult of Jerusalem. A sacrificial state religion centered on a single temple in what is now Israel/Palestine. Its practice was primarily based on adherence to certain already-established dietary, moral, and practical restrictions, as well as tithing to the ruling dynasty and a small tribe of priests who administered the temple.  
This all changed in 70 CE, when after decades of rebellion and a multi-year siege, soldiers of the Roman Empire entered the city of Jerusalem and sacked it. In the process they destroyed the temple and initiated the modern Jewish diaspora.  
In the absence of temple, the priestly elite, and the the ruling authority, the religion needed to be reformed. An already active movement turning the religion towards legalism, in a very similar path that Christianity and Islam would follow in the next millenium, came to the forefront of Jewish thought. This movement re-focussed the religion from a sacrificial system to a devotional once. Rather than the burnt animal sacrifices of Jerusalem, Judaism came to be marked by the legal interpretation of the original 'Old Testament', endogamy (marriage only within the cultural group), prayer, and practice. This process had been started some hundreds of years earlier. Already, there was developping an oral tradition of laws, philosophy, and theology that came to descrive the religion. This oral collection eventually became what is now known as the Mishnah. In summary, it became a kind of civil and religious common law.  
Some time around 200 CE, a rabbi named Yehuda HaNasi (literally "The Prince") in Roman Judea compiled and editted this oral tradition. In doing so, it was organized into collections known as Sedarim ("orders"), Masekhot ('tractates'), Chapters, and individual mishnahs, usually of the length of what we might call paragraphs. **These will be my documents.**
